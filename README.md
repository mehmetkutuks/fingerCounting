# fingerCounting
This project uses MediaPipe Hands and OpenCV to detect hands in real-time from a webcam feed. It identifies whether the detected hand is right or left, counts the number of fingers raised, and highlights the hand by drawing a bounding box around it.

Key Features:
- Real-time hand detection with MediaPipe

- Differentiation between left and right hands without relying on built-in classification

- Finger counting logic based on landmark positions

- Visual feedback with landmarks, connections, bounding box, and finger count overlay

- Lightweight and easy to extend for custom hand gesture applications
